\problemname{Virus}

Boschua is not very good at cybersecurity. Last month, he turned off the firewall because it wouldn't
let him download cat pictures. Unfortunately, this led to him getting a virus. The virus did something
very strange: it added a bunch of letters to all the filenames.

For example, it might have changed the filename \texttt{katt.png} to \texttt{k\textbf{atteg}att\textbf{o}.p\textbf{i}ng}.
The virus can add letters but can never remove letters.

Now he is searching for a file named $F$, but he has many files on his computer. Can you write a
program that reads the filename $F$ and the name of a file $H$ on his computer, and determines if
$F$ could have been transformed into $H$ by the virus? That is, is it possible that the virus took
the filename $F$ and added letters such that the file is now named $H$?

\section*{Input}
The first line of input contains the string $F$, and the second line contains the string $H$.

Let $|F|$ be the number of characters in $F$, and similarly for $|H|$.
Then, it holds that $1 \le |F| \le |H| \le 32$.

Both $F$ and $H$ contain only the letters \texttt{a}-\texttt{z} and the period.
It is guaranteed that $F$ contains exactly one period. The virus can add periods and letters from \texttt{a}-\texttt{z}.

\section*{Output}  
Print ``Ja'' if $H$ could be the file Boschua is looking for, otherwise print ``Nej''.

\section*{Scoring}
Your solution will be tested on a set of test groups, each worth a number of points. Each test group contains
a set of test cases. To get the points for a test group you need to solve all test cases in the test group.

\begin{tabular}{| l | l | p{12cm} |}
  \hline
  \textbf{Group} & \textbf{Points} & \textbf{Constraints} \\ \hline
  $1$ & $20$ & Each character (and period) appears at most once in each string. \\ \hline
  $2$ & $20$ & $|H| = |F|+1$ \\ \hline
  $3$ & $20$ & $|H| = |F|+2$ \\ \hline
  $4$ & $40$ & No additional constraints. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Explanation of Samples}
In sample 1, the virus could have made the following transformation to convert $F$ into $H$:
\texttt{katt.png} $\Rightarrow$ \texttt{ka\textbf{ttega}tt\textbf{o}.p\textbf{i}ng}.


In sample 2, the virus could have made the following transformation to convert $F$ into $H$:
\texttt{antivirus.exe} $\Rightarrow$ \texttt{a\textbf{aa}ntiv\textbf{is}i\textbf{i}ru\textbf{i}s.e\textbf{g}xe}.


In sample 3, $F$ and $H$ differ at \texttt{png} and \texttt{pgn}. Since the virus cannot change the order of letters, it could not have transformed $F$ into $H$.
